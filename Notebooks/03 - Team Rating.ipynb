    "## Introduction, Reference Domain, and Objectives\n",
    "The Offside project starts from the need of creating a recommendation system based on machine learning which, given a football player, returns a series of players as similar as possible based on a set of technical-tactical data. The reference domain is, obviously, the world of football, and the reference platform for data retrieval is Fbref, a consultation source that includes data relating to players, teams and championships in an easily to consult, -and scrape-, fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that the project intends to adopt is based on a rather simple notion: let's assume we have a two-dimensional Cartesian plane, where each point corresponds to a player based on a pair of technical characteristics of our choice. The players most similar to the original player will be those who have the smallest distance on the Cartesian plane. It is sufficient to raise the plane to n dimensions, one for each of the technical attributes considered, to evaluate the similarity of the players on the hyperplane. The only caveat is that calculating the distance on a n-dimensional plane requires a little bit more effort than doing the same thing for a bi-dimensional plane, but thanks to the use of the Euclidean distance, the problem will be solved quite easily. In the code block that follows, we will begin by importing all the necessary libraries for the model."

    "## Data Retrieval, Parsing, Preparation, Cleaning, and Optimization\n",
    "This section aims to retrieve data from multiple web URLs, each pointing to a webpage on FBref, a website providing comprehensive football statistics and tables. The `leagues_urls` dictionary contains URLs for different football leagues, and the code iterates through this dictionary to scrape data for each league.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pd.read_html()` function is utilized to parse the HTML content of the webpages and extract tables. Before parsing, the `.replace()` method is employed to remove HTML comment tags ('<!--' and '-->') from the webpage content. This ensures that the HTML can be imported correctly and without hidden elements ruining the formatting, allowing `read_html()` to parse it effectively. This workaround was sourced from a StackOverflow discussion (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77548912/how-to-extract-table-from-a-webpage-using-its-id).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each league, the `pd.read_html()` function call fetches the HTML content using `requests.get(url).text`, which is then passed to `read_html()` for parsing. The `attrs` parameter specifies the HTML attribute `id` of the table element to be extracted, which is 'stats_standard', a table containing player attributes. The `[0]` index is used to select the first table matching the specified attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After scraping the data, we prepare it for further analysis and processing. Column names are redefined to enhance clarity and comprehension of the dataset. These new column names categorize various aspects of player information, performance metrics, and expected outcomes. Following the renaming process, the data types of specific columns are adjusted for consistency and suitability for analysis. String columns are converted to the string data type, while categorical columns are converted to the categorical data type for efficient storage and computation. Additionally, numerical data columns are converted to numeric types, with appropriate error handling for inconsistencies or invalid entries. Given that the model will be based on the computation of n-Dimensional Euclidean Distance (with n being the number of attributes considered), having accurate numerical values is crucial for precision and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unnecessary information is removed from the dataset to streamline its structure and optimize analytical processes. Columns such as alphabetical rank and nationality are deemed irrelevant for the intended analysis and thus removed. Similarly, redundant columns are eliminated, including the age attribute (since the year of birth is already provided) and a redundant hyperlink column (the last column, which is a hyperlink provided by FBref). The processed dataset is then exported to a CSV file named `\"players.csv\"` to facilitate future analysis and sharing. Below is a description of the dataset columns as provided by the website.\n",
